# Netflix_data_analysis
This project explores a Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing approximately 3,000 entries across 7 features. The focus is on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into the distribution of genres, content ratings, and visualize emerging trends over time.

# **Introduction**
This project analyzes a Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset obtained from Kaggle, comprising around 3,000 records across 7 attributes. The primary objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution of genres, content ratings, and identify trends over time.

The analysis involves examining the dataset structure, followed by data cleaning and handling of missing values using Python. Various visualizations have been created to illustrate key patterns:
- **Bar charts** to show the distribution of Movies and TV Shows across countries, years, and genres  
- **Line graphs** to highlight trends in the number of titles released annually  
- **Pie charts** to represent the distribution of content ratings

This project serves as hands-on practice in Python-based EDA and data visualization techniques.
